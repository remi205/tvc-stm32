begin |Direct memory access (DMA) is used in order to provide high-speed data transfer between peripherals and memory and between memory and memory. Data can be quickly moved by DMA without any CPU action. This keeps CPU resources free for other operations. The DMA controller combines a powerful dual AHB master bus architecture with independent FIFO to optimize the bandwidth of the system, based on a complex bus matrix architecture. The two DMA controllers have 16 streams in total (8 for each controller), each dedicated to  managing memory access requests from one or more peripherals. Each stream can have  up to 8 channels (requests) in total. And each has an arbiter for handling the priority between DMA requests.
